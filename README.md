# Multiswap Monorepo
Monorepo aggregating all Multiswap repositories as submodules.
Multiswap is a multi-chain fork of Uniswap.

## Git Submodules
Unlike other monorepos, this one relies on git submodules to reference other Multiswap git repos.
This makes it simple to keep track of the various forked repos we use while also giving the possibility of combining them as one in this repo.
See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules on using git submodules.
